# ECE 6565 Final Project

This project attempts to determine whether or not applications are malware or not. To do this, it utilizes logs collected from a custom ROM that keeps track of certain API calls.

A simple clustering approach was used in a single dimension. The metric used was a score assigned based on the likelihood a given API call is made in the known malware logs.


## Setup

Log files are to use the CSV format output by the utility provided to the class.

Place known logs for known samples in the following directories:

    ./samples/malware       -- for known malware logs
    ./samples/clean         -- for legitimate application logs

Place logs for unknown samples in the following directory for analysis:

    ./samples/unknown       -- for not yet analyzed applications

Place the list of keywords in the following directory:

    ./library

This list of keywords has every term on a newline.
Do not leave a newline as the last line of the file or else it will be interpreted as a keyword.

If any filenames are changed, reflect the changes in the configuration
section of the "malware_anlysis.m" file.

Classification method may be changed using the configuration in "malware_anlysis.m"

## Running

To run the program simply run the `malware\_analysis.m` file. The results of
the run will be plotted and exported to the `report.txt` file unless the configuration
in `malware_analysis.m` has been changed.

Two clustering methods are available by changing the `method` variable in`malware_analysis.m`.

    KMEANS         -- use kmeans clustering
    THRESH         -- use a simple threshold
